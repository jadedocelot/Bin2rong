# What is PyTorch

- Its a Python-based scientific computing package targeted at two sets of audiences:

    * A replacement for NumPy to use the power of GPUs
    * A deep learning research platform that provides maximum flexibility and speed



# Autograd: Automatic Differentiation

- Imaginge you want to test a new machine learning model for your data. This usually means coming up with some loss function to capture how well your model fits the data and optimizing that loss with repect of the mode parameters`

    - Autograd
        * Autograd package provides automatic differentiation for all operations on Tensors. It is a define-by-run framework, which means that your backdrop is defined by how your code is run, and that every single iteration can be different.
