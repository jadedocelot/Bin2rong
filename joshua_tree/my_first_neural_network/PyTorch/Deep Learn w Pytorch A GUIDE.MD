# Why Pytorch for Deep Learning

 * Pytorch is a library based on Python developed to implemet flexibility regarding the 	developemnt of deep learning.

- Why should you used Pytorch to build deep learning models?

 * Simplicity of use it is a simple API to use
 * Dynamic computation graphs it comes with a framework which we can use to build computation graphs with specific functionalities.

# Tensors

- Tensors are data structures that look like martrices and they are very critical components for effient computation in deep learning.
