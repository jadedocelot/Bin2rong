																		 # C++ What is OOP?

OOP stand of Object Oriented Programming

	- Procedural programming is about writting procedures or functions to perform operations on the data, while object-ortiented programming is about creating objects that contain both data and functions

	- Object oriented programming has several advantages over procedural programming:
		* OOP is faster and easier to execute
		* OOP provides a clear structure for the programs
		* OOP helos to keep C++ code DRT ("Dont Repeat Yourself") and makes the code easier to maintain, modify, and debug
		* OOP makes it possible to create full  reusable applications with less code and shorter development time

	NOTE: The "Dont Repeat Yourself" principle is about reducing the repetition of code. You should extract out the codes that are common for application, and place them at a single place and reuse them instead of repeating.




																		# C++ What are Classes and Objects

    - Classes and object are the two main aspects if object-oriented programming

    EXAMPLE 1:
    ----------
    CLASS:

    	- FRUIT

    OBJECTS: 

    	- Apple
    	- Banana 
    	- Mango


    EXAMPLE 2: 
    ----------
    CLASS:

    	- CAR

    OBJECTS:

    	- VOLVO
    	- AUDI 	
    	- TOYOTA




 - A class is the template for the objects, and an object is an instance of a class.

 	- When the individual objects are created, they inherit all the variables and functions from a class
