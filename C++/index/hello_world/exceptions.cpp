- When executing C++ code, different errors can occur: coding errors made by the programmer, errors dude wrong input, or other unforesceeable things.

// Is this similar to the try/except
- When an error occurs, C++ will normally stop and generate an error message. The technical term for this is: C++ will throw an exception (throw an error)


	C++ try and catch
