- Object Oriented Programming
	
	- This is a STYLE or STRATAGY of developing an application/software. It is a methodolgy.

	- Other methodolgies consist of structure programming, procedural programming, modular programming, and aspect oriented programming. 

 	- OOP deals with INTERNAL designing, NOT EXTERNAL.
 	- In no way is it related to the user of the software but the users but moreso intended for the programmers of said software.
 	

- C programming supports PROCEDURAL and MODULAR programming 


- Say you're developing an app for a bank:


Modular Programming: 
____________________

	- openAcc()
	- deposit()
	- withdraw()
	- checkbal()
	- applyloan()

		* As you can see we are using nothing but functions, the user of this application will be utilyzing the above functions  



Object-Oriented Programming: 
____________________________


- GOVT  <- software

	 	- The items listed below are departments

	
	* Electric
		newConnection()  <- functions
		close() 		 <- functions
		billPay()

	* Water


	* Education  <- Objects


	* Transport


	* Banks
		deposit() 		<- functions
		withdraw()     



 - A complete system/software is complete set of objects, each function has its own functions as well as data related to those funnctions

				 	Principles of Object-Oriented 
			______________________________________________


SET OF PRINCIPLES:



1. Abstraction	 


2. Ecapsulation
	
		- Data Hiding


3. Inheritance


4.Polymorphism




- There are TWO elements of programming:
	 
	 1. Data

	 2. Functions()


  

class myClass
{
	private:
	 	1. Data

	public: 	
		2. Functions	

}


- The only user of a class is programmer (for an outside user does not need to know how the said item works only its functions) 

- When a class helps the class keep the function and the data together that is encapsulation
