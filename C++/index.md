# C ++ Introduction
____________________

C++ is a cross-platform language that can be used to create high-performance application. 

C++ was created by Bjarne Stroustrup 
    * https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bjarne_Stroustrup

C++ gives programmers a high level of control over system recources and memory

    - The language has been updated 3 major times:
        * 2011 
        * 2014
        * 2017 
    
    which presents programmers with C++ 11, C++ 14, and C++17

## Why use C++
________________

Well first off, Python is one of the most popular programming languages (Video game central)
    * The first version of Ratified in 1998 was simply known as C++ 

But C++ can also be found in other (WAY MORE IMPORTANT) projects such as:
    - Operating Systems 
    - Graphical user interfaces (GUI) -- TODO  
    - Embedded systems 

C++ is an OBJECT ORIENTED programming language which gives a clear structure to programs and allows code to be reused, "lowering development cost". C++ is also portable and can be used to develop applications that can be adapted to multiple platforms

"C++ is fun and EASY to learn" <---- HHHHAAA!! 

Langugas that C++ is similar to are C and JAVA  

## Getting started with C++ 

To create C++ code and run it, you will need two things:
    * A text editort (To write the code)
    * A compiler, like GCC (To translate the code into a language the computer can understand)

You can also intall an IDE (Integrated Development Eviroment) which is used to edit AND compile code
    * Visual Studio Code 
        - VSC can be used to edit and DEBUG C++ code
