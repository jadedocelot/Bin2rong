					C constants

- Constants refer to fixed values that the program may not alter during an execution.

	-- These are fixed  values are also called (literals)

- Constants can be of any data type, like an (int) constant, a (float) constant, a (char) constant, or a (string) constant. There are also (emumeration) constants as well.

- Constant are treated like regular variables though their value cannot be modified after their definition




	INTEGER LITERALS
   __________________


   			- An integer literal can be a decimal, octal, or hexadecimal constants. A prefix specifies the base. of radix. Ox or 0x for hexadecimal, 0 for octal and nothing for decimal.

   			- An integer literal can also have a suffix that is a combination of U and L, for 		(unsigned) and (long), respectively. The suffix can be uppercase or lowercase and can be in any order. 

   		BELOW ARE SOME EXAMPLES OF INTEGER LITERALS:

   			212		  // LEGAL
			215u     // LEGAL
			0xFeel  //  LEGAL
			078	   // ILLEGAL: 8 is not an octal digit
			032UU // ILLEGAL: cannot repeat a suffix 


		FOLLOWING  ARE OTHER EXAMPLES OF VARIOS TYPES OF INTEGER LITERALS 


			85 	    	// Decimal
			0213       // OCTAL 
			0x4b      // hexadecimal
			30       // int
			30u     // unsigned int
			30l    // long
			30ul  // unsigned long
