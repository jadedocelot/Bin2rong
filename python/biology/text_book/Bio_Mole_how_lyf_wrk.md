# Bioschemistry and Molecular Biology - How Life Works

## Course Scope

    - Biochemistry explains how all life on earth funtions
    - Biochemistry combines biology the science of life and chemistry, the science of molecules
    - "Every single thing that makes people alive is due to biological molecules and their interactions.
    -  Water, the most abundant molecule in the body (Large QTYs)
    - Amino Acids, proteins, and enzymes
    - Proteins provide the flexability which enables everything from speeding up the reactions to meeting the bodys needs for oxygen
    - Biomolecules: Lipids and carbohydrates
        
        * Lipid: A biolmolecule that is soluble in nonpolar solvents. Non-polar solvents are typically hydrocarbons used to dissolve other naturally 
          occurring hydrocarbon lipid molecules that do not (or do not easily) dissolve in water, including fatty accids, waxes, sterols, fat-soluble
          vitamins (such as vitamins A,D,E, and K), monoglyverides, diglycerides, triglycerides, and phospolipids. They are also cosidered macromolecules

## More Facts
    - DNA is made up of three diffrent things: Sugar, Phosphatem and Bases. Thes are are joined together to make one really long chain that forms
      the shape  of a double-helix
