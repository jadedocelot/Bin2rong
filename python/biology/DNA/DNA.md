# Molecules


# DNA 

- A Spiralling chain like molecule made up of nucleotides. DNA nucleotides come in 4 different types: A, C , T. and G 

* BASES: The bases in the rungs of the DNA ladder come in four types;
        * Adenin (A)
        * Thymine (T)
        * Cytonine (C)
        * Guanine (G)
* Adenine(A) pairs with Thymine(T) in the DOUBLE HELIX, and Cytosine(C), which pairs with guanine (G)

- Transcriptions: When a protein needs to be made, the gene that makes it must be ACTIVATED. This process is called TRANSCRIPTION.	

* DNA cant leave the NUCLEUS of the cell, so instead, a temporary copy of the DNA code is transcribed into a molecule of messanger RNA (mRNA), which can leave the nucleus
* The DNA code is made up of genes. Genes only read once they get a "go" signal from its cell.

# RNA
Ribonncleic Acid (RNA) is very similar to DNA, but is only half of a DOUBLE-HELIX. It is used to make a temporary copy of the DNA sequence when a gene is used.


# Chromosomes 
- A chromosome is an entire chain of DNA along with a group of stabalizing proteins 
- Chromosomes are only packaged tightly when when a cell is repoducing. This helps with durability as the cell is splitting in 2.
- Chromosome is a long DNA molecule
- Most EUKARYOTIC chromosomes include packaging proteins called HISTONES, which aided by chaperone proteins, bind and condense the DNA molecule to maintain integrity
- What are Chromosomes? Chromosomes contain DNA, and they keep all the genetic information safe. Different organisms have different numbers of chromosomes. We have 46
chromosomes, guinea pigs have 64, and chimps have 48  - the same number as potatoes.

- Each chromosome contains one continuous molecule of DNA. Our biggest chromosome is 249,956,422 bases (A,T,C,G) long. If you were to write all the letters out in a book,youd need 16,597 books just for that one chromosome.

* Ribosomes: Ribosomes are tiny factories inside a cell that makes proteins. RNA copies of the genes are delivered to ribomes. There, they are decoded to make the correct proteins.
* Base pairs (the building material of DNA)
- Human Chromosomes: Humans have 23 pairs of chromosomes, 46 in total. One chromosome in each of the pairs comes from each of your biological parents.
* Girls have two X chromosomes and boys have one X and one Y

- Chromosomes are usually visible under a light microscope


# Proteins
- DNA is the instruction manual of the cell, but proteins do all the work! 
- Proteins allow cells to do all the things things they need to do to keep our bodies working. They often act as tine but very complicated machines

- Chaperone (proteins): Otherwise known as molecular chaperones are proteins that assist the conformational folding or unfolding and the assembly or disassembly of other
macromelecular structures.

# GENES

- A LONG stretch of DNA that codes for something, usually a protein or a group of proteins. A typical human gene may be anywhere from 300 to 1,000,000 nucleotide pairs long

- Genes make proteins

# Mutation
 - Any change in the nucleotide sequence of a chain of DNA/RNA
