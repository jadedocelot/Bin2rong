# DNA 

- Transcriptions: When a protein needs to be made, the gene that makes it must be ACTIVATED. This process is called TRANSCRIPTION.	

* DNA cant leave the NUCLEUS of the cell, so instead, a temporary copy of the DNA code is transcribed into a molecule of messanger RNA (mRNA), which can leave the nucleus
* The DNA code is made up of genes. Genes only read once they get a "go" signal from its cell.

# RNA
Ribonncleic Acid (RNA) is very similar to DNA, but is only half of a DOUBLE-HELIX. It is used to make a temporary copy of the DNA sequence when a gene is used.


# Chromosomes
- Each chromosome contains one continuous molecule of DNA. Our biggest chromosome is 249,956,422 bases (A,T,C,G) long. If you were to write all the letters out in a book,youd need 16,597 books just for that one chromosome.

* BASES: The bases in the rungs of the DNA ladder come in four types;
	* Adenin (A)
	* Thymine (T)
	* Cytonine (C)
	* Guanine (G)
* Adenine(A) pairs with Thymine(T) in the DOUBLE HELIX, and Cytosine(C), which pairs with guanine (G)
* Ribosomes: Ribosomes are tiny factories inside a cell that makes proteins. RNA copies of the genes are delivered to ribomes. There, they are decoded to make the correct proteins.



# GENES

- Genes make proteins
