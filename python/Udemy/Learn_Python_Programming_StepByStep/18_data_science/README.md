- Data is raw facts and figure and after processing the data we get some meaningful information

- Nowadays storing data is not a big deal there are some frameworks that have successfully solved the problem of storage, the real challenge is processing of this data

- The data is generated from different sources and in a different format. simple tools are not capable of processing this huge volume, and complex data, algorithms and systems to extract knowledge and insigts from data in various forms, both structured and unstructured, similar to data mining.


### NumPy:
    Is a library for the python programming language, adding support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a large collection of high-level mathematical functions to operate on these arrays.

### Matplotlib:
    is a plotting library for the Python programming language. It is Python 2D plotting library which can generate plots, hitstograms, power spectra, bar charts, area chart, scatterplots ETC

### Pandas:
    is an open source library providing high performance, easy to use data structures and data analysis tools for the Python programming language.
